Abortion in Tennessee is expected to be illegal from fertilization beginning in late August, 2022, thirty days after the Tennessee Attorney General notifies the Tennessee Code Commission that Roe v. Wade was overturned on June 24, 2022., a notification that has not occurred as of July 23, 2022. Currently, abortion is banned after embryonic cardiac-cell activity can be detected, which is usually six weeks after the first day of the woman's last menstrual period.

The number of abortion clinics in Tennessee has decreased over the years, with 128 in 1982, 33 in 1992, and 7 in 2014. There were 12,373 legal abortions in 2014, and 11,411 in 2015.

Terminology
The abortion debate most commonly relates to the "induced abortion" of a pregnancy, which is also how the term is used in a legal sense. Some also use the term "elective abortion", which is used in relation to a claim to an unrestricted right of a woman to an abortion, whether or not she chooses to have one. The term elective abortion or voluntary abortion describes the interruption of pregnancy before viability at the request of the woman, but not for medical reasons.Anti-abortion advocates tend to use terms such as "unborn baby", "unborn child", or "pre-born child", and see the medical terms "embryo", "zygote", and "fetus" as dehumanizing. Both "pro-choice" and "pro-life" are examples of terms labeled as political framing: they are terms which purposely try to define their philosophies in the best possible light, while by definition attempting to describe their opposition in the worst possible light. "Pro-choice" implies that the alternative viewpoint is "anti-choice", while "pro-life" implies the alternative viewpoint is "pro-death" or "anti-life". The Associated Press encourages journalists to use the terms "abortion rights" and "anti-abortion".

Context
Free birth control correlates to teenage girls having fewer pregnancies and fewer abortions. A 2014 New England Journal of Medicine study found such a link.  The Guttmacher Institute found that in 2014, 51% of women who had an abortion used some sort of method of contraception in the month they became pregnant. At the same time, a 2011 study by Center for Reproductive Rights and Ibis Reproductive Health also found that states with more abortion restrictions have higher rates of maternal death, higher rates of uninsured pregnant women, higher rates of infant and child deaths, higher rates of teen drug and alcohol abuse, and lower rates of cancer screening.According to a 2017 report from the Center for Reproductive Rights and Ibis Reproductive Health, states that tried to pass additional constraints on a women's ability to access legal abortions had fewer policies supporting women's health, maternal health and children's health.  These states also tended to resist expanding Medicaid, family leave, medical leave, and sex education in public schools. According to Megan Donovan, a senior policy manager at the Guttmacher Institute, states have legislation seeking to protect a woman's right to access abortion services have the lowest rates of infant mortality in the United States.

History
Legislative history
The state was one of 10 states in 2007 to have a customary informed consent provision for abortions. In 2013, state Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers (TRAP) had provisions related to admitting privileges and licensing.  They required clinics have hospital privileges and transfer agreement with a hospital.The state legislature was one of eight states nationwide that tried, and failed, to pass a fetal heartbeat bill in 2017. They tried again in 2018, where they were one of ten states that tried and failed to pass a fetal heartbeat bill. Two fetal heartbeat bills were filed in the Tennessee General Assembly in 2019. On January 23, 2019, Rep. James "Micah" Van Huss filed HB 77 in the Tennessee House of Representatives. On February 7, 2019, Sen. Mark Pody filed SB 1236 in the Tennessee Senate. On February 20, 2019, HB 77 was passed out of a Public Health subcommittee and sent to the full committee. On February 26, 2019, the House Public Health Committee voted 15–4 to send HB 77 to the House floor for a full vote. On February 7, 2019, HB 77 was passed out of the Tennessee House by a vote of 66–21. As of May 14, 2019, the state prohibited abortions after the fetus was viable, generally at some point between weeks 24 and 28.  This period uses a standard defined by the US Supreme Court in 1973 with the Roe v. Wade ruling and was not a result of state-based legislation. In 2020 Tennessee banned abortions because of a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome or because of the gender or race of the fetus.Due to the trigger law prohibiting abortion from the point of fertilization which was adopted on April 22, 2019, abortion will become illegal from the point of conception in Tennessee on July 24, 2022, 30 days after the overturning of Roe v. Wade.

Judicial history
The US Supreme Court's decision in 1973's Roe v. Wade ruling meant the state could no longer regulate abortion in the first trimester.
Tennessee's heartbeat bill and the Texas-style abortion ban have been in court due to pro-choice organizations suing the state of Tennessee. The bill that effectively bans abortion in the state of Tennessee currently has a preliminary injunction according to the ACLU.

Clinic history
Between 1982 and 1992, the number of abortion clinics in the state declined by 47, going from 128 in 1982 to 33 in 1992. In 2014, there were seven abortion clinics in the state. In 2014, 96% of the counties in the state did not have an abortion clinic. That year, 63% of women in the state aged 15–44 lived in a county without an abortion clinic. In 2017, there were four Planned Parenthood clinics, all of which offered abortion services, in a state with a population of 1,519,130 women aged 15–49.

Abortion rights views and activities
Protests
According to local news, hundreds of people attended the March for Life in Knoxville supporting abortion bans and restrictions.Women from the state participated in marches supporting abortion rights as part of a #StoptheBans movement in May 2019.In Memphis and Nashville, groups of people gathered to protest the abortion ban that would take place if Roe v. Wade is overturned before the decision was finalized. Many women shared their abortion stories at the protest.

Opposition in Cities
On July 13, 2022, the Memphis City council passed the Reproductive Autonomy is Necessary (RAIN) Act in an effort to lessen the extent to which statewide policy will affect childbearing people in Memphis.

The Political Divide

One of the biggest groups of women who oppose legalized abortion in the United States is southern white evangelical Christians.  These women voted overwhelmingly for Trump, with 80% of these voters supporting him at the ballot box in 2016. In November 2018, during US House exit polling, 75% of southern white evangelical Christian women indicated they supported Trump and only 20% said they voted for Democratic candidates.
