A series of ongoing protests supporting abortion rights and anti-abortion counter-protests began in the United States on May 2, 2022, following the leak of a draft majority opinion for the U.S. Supreme Court case Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which stated that the Constitution of the United States does not confer any right to abortion, thus overturning Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. On June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court officially overturned Roe and Casey in Dobbs, resulting in further protests outside of the U.S. Supreme Court building and across the country.

Background
Leaked draft opinion
On May 2, 2022, Politico released a first draft of a majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito, the authenticity of which Politico said it had verified. The draft opinion would overturn Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey if held by the majority and thereby finalized in that form. Alito's draft decision called the Roe decision "egregiously wrong from the start" on the grounds that abortion is not listed in the United States Constitution as a protected right, and instead would allow states to decide on abortion restrictions or guarantees under the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.Shortly after the release of the document, multiple protests occurred in cities throughout the country and outside the U.S. Supreme Court Building in Washington, D.C., along with multiple individuals such as lawyers, politicians, and activist groups speaking out about the leaked draft.

Overturning of Roe v. Wade
On June 24, 2022, in a 5â€“4 decision, the Supreme Court officially overturned Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. The decision was divisive among the American public, with 55 to 60% opposed to the overturning of Roe, and was generally condemned by international observers and foreign leaders, resulting in further protests.

Protests before the ruling
According to The Hill, the Reproductive Freedom Protest (RFP) planned walkouts at more than 20 U.S. universities, including Brown University, Florida International University, Georgetown University, Hamilton College, Purdue University, the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, and Virginia Tech.

About protests outside private homes
After protests outside of the homes of Justices John Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh in early May 2022, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki tweeted that while President Joe Biden was a strong believer in the constitutional right to protest, it should never include violence, threats, or vandalism. Psaki added that Judges were a highly important function in the United States and must be able to do their jobs without concern for personal safety. The U.S. Capitol Police and the National Fusion Center Association alerted to potential violence in Washington, D.C., against the nine justices and their staffs as well as nationwide against abortion-related advocacy groups and First Amendment-protected events. In May, senators Chris Coons (D-DE) and John Cornyn (R-TX) introduced legislation to allow Supreme Court Police to provide all nine justices and their families 24-hour protection. The bill passed the U.S. House of Representatives on June 14 in a 396â€“27 vote, with opposition from some New Jersey Democrats who wished to broaden the bill to also protect the family members of Supreme Court staff, and was signed into law by President Biden on June 16.Republicans argued that those protests violate a 1950 federal law that criminalizes attempting to influence a judge in the course of their official duties by demonstrating at their residence. Maryland governor Larry Hogan and Virginia governor Glenn Youngkin cited the law in a request to the U.S. Department of Justice for adequate resources to protect the justices and their families. Justice Clarence Thomas said the Supreme Court would not "be bullied" by the demonstrators. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) stated in an interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox News that the protests at the Justices homes were "mob violence to get their partisan outcome"; however, reports from both protests claimed to show no violence and about 100 protestors attending the protests.On May 16, Florida governor Ron DeSantis signed a law making it a second-degree misdemeanor to protest in front of private citizen's homes in Florida, saying, "Sending unruly mobs to private residences, like we have seen with the angry crowds in front of the homes of Supreme Court justices, is inappropriate."
